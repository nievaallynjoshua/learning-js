/*
Let's say you're building a time tracking application for freelancers. At some point in building this app, you need a function that receives daily work hours for a certain week, and returns:
1. Total hours worked
2. Average daily hours
3. The day with the most hours worked
4. Number of days worked
5. Whether the week was full-time (worked 35 hours or more)

TEST DATA: [7.5, 8, 6.5, 0, 8.5, 4, 0]

function analyzeWorkWeek(hours) {
  // 1. Total hours worked
  const totalHours = hours.reduce((acc, current) => acc + current, 0);

  // 4. Number of days worked (days where hours > 0)
  const daysWorked = hours.filter(h => h > 0).length;

  // 2. Average daily hours (only based on days actually worked)
  const averageHours = daysWorked > 0 ? totalHours / daysWorked : 0;

  // 3. The day with the most hours worked
  const maxHours = Math.max(...hours);
  const dayNames = [
    "Monday",
    "Tuesday",
    "Wednesday",
    "Thursday",
    "Friday",
    "Saturday",
    "Sunday",
  ];
  const bestDay = dayNames[hours.indexOf(maxHours)];

  // 5. Whether the week was full-time (35 hours or more)
  const isFullTime = totalHours >= 35;

  return {
    totalHours,
    averageHours: averageHours.toFixed(2), // Rounds to 2 decimal places
    bestDay,
    daysWorked,
    isFullTime,
