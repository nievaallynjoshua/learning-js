// Values and Variables
// Declare variables called country, continent and population and assign their values according to your own country (population in millions).

// Log their values to the console.
const country = "Philippines";

let population = 112;

console.log(country);

console.log(population);

// Data types
// Declare a variable called isIsland and set its value according to your country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable language, but don't assign it any value yet.

// Log the types of isIsland, population, country and language to the console.
const isIsland = true;
let language;

console.log(typeof isIsland);
console.log(typeof population);
console.log(typeof country);

//let, const, var
// Set the value of language to the language spoken where you live (some countries have multiple languages, but just choose one).

// Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.

// Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens.
language = "Filipino";

// Basic Operators
// If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population, then how many people would live in each half?

// Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console.

// Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than Finland?

// The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does you country have less people than the average country?

// Based on the variables you created, create a new variable description which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million people speak portuguese'.

// Recreate the description variable from the last assignment, this time using the template literal syntax.

//Taking Decisions: if / else Statements
// If your country's population is greater than 33 million, log a string like this to the console: "Portugal's population is 22 million below average" (the 22 is the average of 33 minus the country's population).

// After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to 130. See the different results, and set the population back to original.

//Type coercion and conversion
console.log("9" - "5"); // -> 4
console.log("19" - "13" + "17"); // -> '617'

console.log("123" < 57); // -> false
console.log(5 + 6 + "4" + 9 - 4 - 2); // -> 1143

//Equality Operators == vs ===
// Declare a variable numNeighbours based on a prompt input like this:
// prompt('How many neighbour countries does your contry have?');

// If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality == for now).

// Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case numNeighbours is greater than 1.

// Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when numNeighbours is 0 or any other value).

// Test the code with different values of numNeighbours, including 1 and 0.

// Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of numNeighbours. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why is this happening?

// Finally, convert numNeighbours to a number, and watch what happens now when you input 1.

// Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this situation.

//Logical Operators
// Comment out the previous code so the prompt doesn't get in the way.

// Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in a country that speaks English, has less than 50 million people and is not an island.

// If yours is the right country, log a strings like this 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('.
